## TODO
- separate arithmetic operations for small numbers => faster operations with small numbers
- optimized division using binary search (instead of linear search)
- failed extraction from stream (throw an exception)
- negative numbers; negative difference (support substraction with the first number smaller than the second)
- memory optimization using bigger bases (base 10^19 => using a unsigned long long to store the digits => half the memory)
