# Projects
Diverse programming-related ideas that came to my mind along my competitive programming journey and i decided to code them. They revolve around:
- **math** (root number sieve, number of bits sieve)
- **OOP** (dynamic array)
- **data structures** (sieve range minimum query) and much more.
